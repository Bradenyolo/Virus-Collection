all these viruses are fake so you can run them on your host.

also random viruses like creepy.bat probably looks like it hacks you,


but it will not since i used "copy C:\users\braden(or%userprofile%)\desktop\creepy.bat C:\windows\temp" and

                             "del C:\users\braden(or%userprofile%)\desktop\creepy.bat"
                             
                             and then added some "echo code" so that it looks like im sending a text document remotely.


viruses that are not safe tell me to remove them in my discord server which is in my readme.md(bradenyolo repositiory)
