This virus will delete program files, and everything on your desktop. Not only will it delete files, it will disable (almost) every app in your device, including Control Panel, and others. It will change the userinit key to `C:\Windows\system32\userinit.exe,C:\unknown programs\Mbr.exe`
Mbr.exe will also have a 24 hour time to overwrite the MBR to a (little like) creepy trees image.
**Make sure you have a backup folder to put everything back in your desktop and a backup folder for all programs!**
**Also, make sure you have some .reg files to repair everything back!**

Download link isn't currently here yet, I'll try to fix the problem ASAP (I can't).
