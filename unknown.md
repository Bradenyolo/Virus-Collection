This virus will delete programs and create a folder to make some registry items work.
Do not send this to your friends, families, or work PCs. Every app will be disabled, wallpaper and others will be changed.
It will also delete in `C:\Users\Public\Public Desktop` , (probably every short cut is there)

Download link isn't currently here yet, I'll try to fix the problem ASAP (I can't).
