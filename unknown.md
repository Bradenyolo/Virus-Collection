This virus will delete programs and create a folder to make some registry items work.
Do not send this to your friends, families, or work PCs. If you do this, they will have their computer for 1 last day. Because of timer.exe having not so much time that deletes services, you're going to kill your device. 

What the virus does:
{
Deletes programs, and shortcuts.
Deletes your important personal files that are on your desktop.
Timer.exe is set as userinit.
What timer.exe does
{
   Has a 30 minute timer to delete services and (probably) modify
   the BSoD.
}
  It also disables almost every app.
  The virus disables CMD after the command scripts have been running.
  Task manager is not disabled because every virus process is a critical.
  Sends 404 text files, after sending the first 30 text files, create a file called
  `README.txt`
}

**Use a virtual environment before testing!**
